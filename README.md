Full Stack Developer Merchandise 

Full Stack Developer Merchandise website offers branded products with original designs for Full Stack Developers. Products include mugs, t-shirts, magnets, stickers, and hoodies. 

Users of the website will be able to access direct links to the actual online store https://www.redbubble.com/people/camidigital/shop on redbubble.com created by the author (me) and to view and purchase products in my (camidigital) redbubble.com shop (the are other products in the shop, this Project 1 and products on this website created for Full Stack Developer Merchandise only). 

The idea of this particular product came to mind because of a need for a new notebook, as one provided by Code Institute for this boot camp started to run out due to many notes taken in the class. Then the author created the original logo and design for the Full Stack Developer Notebook (appears on the first page of the website) the design was implemented using the PhotoScape X version and then the design was uploaded to redbubble.com (print on demand website for independent artists). 

The project solved a problem and the designed notebook was purchased, and designs were applied to other products hoodies, mugs and stickers.
